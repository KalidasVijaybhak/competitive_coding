In computing, a hash table, also known as hash map, is a data structure that implements an associative array or dictionary. It is an abstract data type that maps keys to values. A hash table uses a hash function to compute an index, also called a hash code, into an array of buckets or slots, from which the desired value can be found. During lookup, the key is hashed and the resulting hash indicates where the corresponding value is stored.

Ideally, the hash function will assign each key to a unique bucket, but most hash table designs employ an imperfect hash function, which might cause hash collisions where the hash function generates the same index for more than one key. Such collisions are typically accommodated in some way.

# Stack

linear data structure
Insertion and deletion are only allowed at the end called top
## Operation 
push(data)
pop()
top()
size()  // returns size of stack
isEmpty() // return true if stack is empty else false
isFull()  //return true if stack is full else false
